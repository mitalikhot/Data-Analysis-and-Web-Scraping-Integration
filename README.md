# Data Analysis and Web Scraping Integration 🕷️📊

This repository demonstrates the end-to-end process of extracting data from the web using scraping techniques and performing comprehensive data analysis to uncover trends and patterns.

# 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how web scraping can be a powerful tool for data collection. By integrating scraping with data analysis libraries, we can transform raw, unstructured web data into actionable business intelligence.

# 🚀 Key Features
• Automated Web Scraping: Extraction of data from targeted websites using robust scraping tools.

• Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Formatting raw HTML/JSON data into structured DataFrames.

• Handling Dynamic Content: Techniques for managing paginated results or dynamically loaded data.

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis and distribution checks (including Skewness and Kurtosis).

• Visualization: Static charts to represent the scraped findings.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
• Languages: Python 3.x

• Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Requests

• Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

• Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

• Environment: Google Colab

# 📊 Concepts Covered
• HTML Parsing: Navigating the DOM to find specific tags and classes.

• Statistical Analysis: Measuring central tendency and data asymmetry (Skewness).

• Data Exporting: Saving scraped data for long-term storage and use.

# 🤝 Contributing
Feel free to fork this project, report issues, or submit pull requests to improve the scraping logic or analysis depth.
