# Data Analysis and Web Scraping Integration 🕷️📊

> **Problem:** What patterns emerge from popular quotes on the web — which authors dominate, what themes recur, and how do quote characteristics vary across the dataset?

This project automates data collection from [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com/) using Python web scraping, then applies Exploratory Data Analysis to surface trends and patterns from the extracted data — covering 100 quotes across 50 unique authors.

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

- 🏆 **Albert Einstein dominates** with 10 quotes — nearly double the next most-quoted author (J.K. Rowling, 9 quotes), making him the single most represented voice in the dataset
- ❤️ **"Love" is the #1 tag** (14 occurrences), followed closely by "inspirational" and "life" (13 each) — revealing a strong bias toward emotionally resonant, motivational content
- 📏 **Quote lengths are heavily right-skewed** (skewness: 4.97), meaning the vast majority of quotes are short and punchy (avg. 122 characters), with a few outliers stretching beyond 1,000 characters
- 📚 **"Books" and "reading" rank in the top 10 tags**, reflecting the literary nature of the source platform and its audience
- 🌐 **50 unique authors** are represented across just 100 quotes, indicating high diversity — no single author monopolises the dataset beyond Einstein

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### Phase 1 — Web Scraping
- Sent HTTP requests to [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com/) using the **Requests** library
- Parsed HTML DOM with **BeautifulSoup** to extract three fields per quote: `Quote`, `Author`, and `Tags`
- Handled multi-page pagination to collect a complete dataset of **100 quotes**
- Exported raw scraped data to `quotes.csv` for reproducibility

### Phase 2 — Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed null and malformed entries
- Parsed comma-separated `Tags` strings into individual tag tokens for frequency analysis
- Computed derived features including `quote_length` (character count) for distribution analysis

### Phase 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis
- Computed **skewness (4.97)** confirming a strong right-skewed distribution in quote lengths — most quotes are brief, with rare long-form outliers
- Ranked authors and tags by frequency to identify the most represented voices and themes
- Generated a **word cloud** from quote text to visualise the most prominent vocabulary

## 📊 Visualizations

### Distribution of Quote Lengths
![Quote Length Distribution](charts/Distribution_of_quotes_lengths.png)
> Quote lengths are right-skewed (skewness: 4.97) — most quotes are under 150 characters, with a long tail of verbose outliers.

### Top 10 Most Common Tags
![Top Tags](charts/Top_most_common_tags.png)
> "Love", "inspirational", and "life" are the dominant themes — the dataset skews heavily toward motivational and emotional content.

### Top 10 Most Quoted Authors
![Top Authors](charts/top_most_quoted_authors.png)
> Albert Einstein leads with 10 quotes. The top 7 authors account for a disproportionate share of the dataset.

### Word Cloud — Most Frequent Words
![Word Cloud](charts/wordcloud.png)
> "Love", "life", "will", "one", and "make" dominate the vocabulary — reinforcing the motivational tone of the corpus.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mitalikhot/Data-Analysis-and-Web-Scraping-Integration.git
   ```
2. Open `Web_Scraping_with_EDA.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter
3. Run all cells to re-scrape and re-analyse — or skip straight to EDA using the pre-scraped `quotes.csv`
